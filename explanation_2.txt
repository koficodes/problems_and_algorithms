Search in Rotated Array
------------------------

The tick for solving this problem is to find the point or position in the array where
the array is rotated this can be called the pivot and then divide the array into subarray
and run binary search on them. The pivot is the value for which the next value is smaller.

Since binary search is used the run time is O(log n) and the space complexity is 0(1)
