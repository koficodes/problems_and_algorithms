Dutch National Flag Problem
----------------------------

The solution to this problem is to arrange the 0's and 2's in the array
and the 1's will be in the right position automatically. The array is traversed once
while arranging the elements of the array.

The run time of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is 0(1)
