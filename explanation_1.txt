Square root
------------

The square root of a number can be considered as a search problem where the numbers to 
search through is 1...m < n where n is the number to find the square root of and m is the 
maximum possible square root which is less the number itself.

The algorithm used is binary search which has a run time of 0(log n) where n is the size
of the list of possible square roots to search through. This algorithm also has a space complexity
of 0(1)
