Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
-------------------------------

The solution to this problem is to start with an initial
minimum and maximum value and then update them while traversing
and comparing the values in the array.
The run time of the solution is 0(n) where n is the size of the array.
The space complexity is O(1)
