Rearrange Array Elements
------------------------
To solve this problem the array needs to be sorted first, after the two numbers are generated using
the odd and even indices of the array elements in alternating order.

The most important part of this solution is the sorting and generation of the two numbers,
with run time of O(nlogn) and O(n) respectively.
The chosen sorting algorithm is mergesort which has a runtime of O(nlogn)
Therefore the runtime for the solution is O(nlogn)
The space complexity of the solution is determined by the sorting algorithm used which is 
O(n).
